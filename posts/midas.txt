Midas
=====

This is the first post dedicated to my future programming language, Midas (the name stands for *Matter Irradiation Dissociative Acceleration System*).

I’ll try to describe some key features.
Treat it as a sneak-peek. Let’s start with:

File-oriented programming
-------------------------

Have you heard of it? Neither have I.
There is no concept of classes & objects.

There are files. If you want to isolate a piece of code,
place it into a different file:

```
<b>vars.mi</b>
foo: 3

<b>app.mi</b>
bar: 4 + 1
bar + ./vars foo
```


This code returns `8`.

Indent-based
------------

I am a Ruby fan, you know.
Somewhere at the very bottom of my soul, I hate it:

        end
      end
    end
  end

C/PHP/Whatever developers, this **is** full of bullshit:

        }
      }
    }
  }

Semantic indentation is the only feature of Python I love, because it *does allow* to write ina drier way.

Philosophy
----------

The philosophy is: use as little characters to write a program you need as possible.

Don’t repeat yourself. Keep it sophisticated.
Hail to regular expressions!
Avoid using words, use symbols.

The language tries to be chaotic as hell (literally).
Chaos is the power. It’s going to be like:

Fast
----

It is a compiled language. Your neat Midas code translates into efficient C, so you don’t need to worry about perfomance-related issues.

More soon.
