Sword is the best designer’s friend forever ever.

Use SASS/Compass, Slim, HAML, LESS, whatever you want, in your everyday needs. Convert it to static and upload to your server when you’re ready.

Install it:

  gem install sword

And run it in your project directory:

  cd documents/project
  sword

`/we/about.haml` is at `localhost:1111/we/about`,
`/main.less` is at `localhost:1111/main.css`,
and so forth.

If you still didn’t get the idea:
there is an [example project](/sword.zip) to get you started!
