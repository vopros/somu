Sword is the best designer’s friend forever ever.

Use SASS/Compass, Slim, HAML, LESS, whatever you want, in your everyday needs. Convert it to static and upload to your server when you’re ready.

Install it:

  gem install sword

And run it in your project directory:

  cd documents/project
  sword

That’s it. `about.haml` is avaliable at [localhost:1111/about](//localhost:1111/about), `css/style.less` is avaliable at [localhost:1111/css/style.css](//localhost:1111/about) and so on.

If you still didn’t get the idea:
there is an [example project](/sword.zip) to get you started!
