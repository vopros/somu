Fizzy
=====

My blog engine, Fizzy, is ready.

[Andreas Pihlström](http://scriptogr.am) inspired me to make an easy-to-use blog engine for a geek like me.

I’ve succeeded, I suppose.
You write a simple Markdown document:

Fizzy renders it part-by-part (long live to regexps).

[Town](http://github.com/somu/town) syntax. Automatic timestamps.
Redis database. Easy to configure.
70 lines of code. Smart cache.

Detailed description coming soon.
